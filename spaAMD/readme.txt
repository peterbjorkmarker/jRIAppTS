This project holds modules which are used in the RIAppDemo project on the SPADemo HTML page.
These modules are loaded using  Asynchronous Module Definition (AMD) by requireJS.
The other demo pages use static loading using script tag.
That's why i separated SPADemo files into a single typescript project.
SPADemo page shows capabilities of the framework for creating Single Page Applications.
It also shows that you can load user modules using requireJS.
Besides this it also shows that ViewModels have no trace of any UI controls (like DataGrid) and don't manipulate the DOM.
They are perfectly testable.

P.S. demoTS project contains typescript modules for all other demo pages in the RIAppDemo project.
