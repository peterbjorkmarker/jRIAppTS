This project holds user modules which are used in the RIAppDemo project in demo pages.
The modules used by the SPADemo HTML page are separated into another project - spaAMD.
The demo pages use static javascript loading using script tag.
But the SPADemo page loads user modules using  Asynchronous Module Definition (AMD) by requireJS.
That's why the use different projects.
